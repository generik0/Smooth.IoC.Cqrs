# Smooth.IoC.Cqrs
Smoothest CQRS implementation, made for IoC and DI.

# Why
We all love patterns and principles. But some patterns difficult to get to work with each other. 
IoC / Dependancy Injection is one of the best design principles i know, but sometimes it is difficult to implement otehr patterns with it, or packages don't take into consideration that theyh should be IoC/DI friendly.

This package is created to do one thing, and do it well... Utilies the basics of CQRS, but make it usable with IoC.
